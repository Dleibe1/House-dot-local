I got this working on an ESP32 S2 Mini and a DOIT ESP32 DevKit V1

Update platform.ini to match the specs of your board

Run extra_scripts.zsh to build the react app and flash it to the ESP32.  
I couldn't get the extra_scripts.py from the guide to work, so I made the extra_scripts.zsh file instead.

I followed this guide for the most part:
